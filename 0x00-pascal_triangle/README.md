# Pascal's Triangle Function

This Python module contains a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.

## Function: `pascal_triangle(n)`

### Description
The `pascal_triangle(n)` function generates Pascal's Triangle for `n` rows and returns it as a list of lists. Each inner list represents a row of the triangle.

### Parameters
- `n` (int): The number of rows in Pascal's Triangle to generate. Must be a non-negative integer.

### Returns
- A list of lists, where each inner list contains the coefficients for that row in Pascal's Triangle.
